This project predicts company profit based on R&D spending, administration costs, marketing spending, and location. 
Using a Multiple Linear Regression model, it identifies which startups might yield better investment returns based on provided financial data.

**Project Overview:**
Algorithm: Multiple Linear Regression
Data: 50 companies with fields for R&D spend, administration, marketing spend, state, and profit.

**Key Steps**
Data Preprocessing: Encoded categorical data (state) and split into training and test sets.
Model Training: Trained a linear regression model on the dataset.
Prediction: Predicted profits for test data to evaluate model accuracy.

**Results**
Comparing predicted and actual profits to determine the reliability of the model and identify high-profit companies for potential investment.

**How to Use**
Clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the notebook or script to view predictions.
